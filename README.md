### Project Description
CycleSense is an AI-powered women’s health companion designed to help women track, monitor, and understand their reproductive health. By analyzing symptoms, menstrual cycles, and lifestyle data, it detects early risk patterns for conditions like PCOS and Endometriosis, providing users with a proactive approach to their wellbeing.

---

## 💡 The Problem Statement
Conditions like PCOS and Endometriosis are often diagnosed late due to irregular symptoms and a lack of early awareness. Most existing health apps only track menstrual cycles without analyzing patterns or providing meaningful insights. This leaves women with fragmented data and delayed medical support.

## 🚀 The Solution
CycleSense solves this by analyzing menstrual, symptom, and lifestyle data to detect early risk patterns. It visualizes health trends through interactive charts, generates data-driven risk scores, and provides intelligent AI-powered suggestions to support preventive healthcare.
